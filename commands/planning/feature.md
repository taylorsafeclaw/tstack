You are the tstack feature orchestrator. Take a feature from description to merged PR.

## Bootstrap

Read these files first:
- `CLAUDE.md` (project root)
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (if exists)
- `package.json` — project scripts and dependencies

## Input

Feature description: $ARGUMENTS

## Step transitions

Before advancing to the next step:
1. Verify the previous step completed successfully
2. Collect the output needed by the next step
3. If the previous step failed, enter error recovery
4. Log the transition: "Step N complete → advancing to Step N+1"

## Pipeline

### Step 0 — Leader Interview

Read `skills/leader/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions for the feature-tier interview (3 questions max).

Header context:
- Feature name: `$ARGUMENTS`
- Model: `o`
- Mission position: read `.tstack/state.json` if it exists — format as `m X/Y`

After premises are locked (◇), carry them forward as constraints for planning and implementation.

### Step 1 — Context + Agent Discovery

**Agent discovery:**
1. Glob `.claude/agents/*.md` to find project-specific agents (installed via templates)
2. If no project agents found, the plugin's core agents are available as fallbacks:
   - `explorer` (sonnet) — read-only codebase exploration
   - `implementer` (sonnet) — generic implementation
3. Read frontmatter of discovered agents to extract: name, domain, description, model
4. Build agent roster grouped by domain
5. Match plan tasks to agents by domain:
   - schema tasks → agents with domain: schema
   - backend tasks → agents with domain: backend
   - infrastructure tasks → agents with domain: infrastructure (parallel with backend if independent)
   - integration tasks → agents with domain: integration (after backend, needs API shape)
   - frontend tasks → agents with domain: frontend (last, consumes backend API)
   - testing tasks → agents with domain: testing (after implementation)
   - review tasks → agents with domain: review (after testing)
   - quality tasks → agents with domain: quality (final gate)

**Codebase exploration:**
Use the Agent tool to explore the codebase:
- **subagent_type:** "Explore"
- **description:** "explore context for feature"
- **prompt:** "Investigate the codebase for feature: $ARGUMENTS. Find: (1) Files this feature will touch, (2) Existing patterns and conventions for this area, (3) Dependencies and related code, (4) Which domain agents apply. Return structured findings with file:line references."

Collect from the explorer:
- Files to touch
- Patterns to follow
- Which domains are involved
- Available agents (from discovery above)

### Step 1.5 — State reads

Read state files if they exist:
- `.tstack/STATE.md` — project position, what's in progress, resume instructions
- `.tstack/DECISIONS.md` — locked decisions to respect

Ensure `.tstack` directory exists for state writes:
```bash
mkdir -p .tstack
```

If a mission is active (`.tstack/state.json` exists), determine the current feature number and create the feature directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .tstack/features/<n>
```

**Initialize state files (if they don't exist):**
If `.tstack/STATE.md` doesn't exist, create it with:
- Current Position: Feature — $ARGUMENTS, Phase: planning, Branch: (current)
- What's In Progress: "Starting feature: $ARGUMENTS"
- Resume Instructions: "Confirm plan, then begin implementation"

This enables `/resume` to work even for standalone features (no mission required).

**Write RESEARCH.md** from explorer findings:
Write `.tstack/features/<n>/RESEARCH.md` (or `RESEARCH.md` in project root if no mission) with:
- Files to touch (path:line — what needs changing)
- Existing patterns (pattern name: where)
- Dependencies
- Risks

### Step 2 — Plan

Based on context:
- If touching ≤3 files in one domain: plan stays in conversation (3-5 bullet points)
- If touching >3 files or multiple domains: write `plan.md` with task checklist
- If a mission is active (`.tstack/state.json` exists): write to `.tstack/features/<current>/plan.md`

The plan should identify:
- What backend changes are needed (mutations, queries, schema)
- What UI changes are needed (components, state, routing)
- Dependencies between tasks (what blocks what)
- Which agent handles each chunk (matched by domain from Step 1)

Size each chunk to ~50% of a fresh context window — don't overload agents.

**Update STATE.md** with current position:
- Phase: planning
- Feature: name and number
- What's In Progress: "Planning feature: <name>"

### Step 3 — Confirm

Show the plan to the user. Ask: "Does this look right? Any changes before I start?"

**Wait for confirmation before proceeding.**

### Step 4 — Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/<slug>
```
Where `<slug>` is a 2-4 word kebab-case summary.

### Step 5 — Implement (Agent coordination)

Use the agent roster from Step 1. Dispatch agents by domain in this order:

**Dispatch order:** schema → backend → infrastructure (parallel if independent) → integration → frontend → testing → review → quality

For each domain with tasks in the plan:

1. Find the agent with the matching `domain` from the roster
2. Spawn it using the Agent tool with:
   - Their specific tasks from the plan
   - Files they own (no overlap with other agents)
   - Patterns to follow (from context)
   - API shape from prior agents (if applicable)
   - "Commit atomically per logical chunk. Return: what was implemented, files modified, API shape."
3. After each agent completes:
   - Extract API shape / handoff data from the return
   - **Update STATE.md**: mark completed tasks, update "What's In Progress"
   - **Append to AGENTS.md**: timestamp, agent name, task, status, files, handoff data
   - Mark completed tasks in plan.md
4. Pass handoff data to the next agent in sequence

**Fallback — No domain agents:**

1. Check for `implementer` agent (global): `~/.claude/agents/implementer.md`
2. If available: spawn implementer with full task context
3. If not: implement directly in main context following existing patterns

Each agent commits atomically per logical chunk. Conventional commit format:
```
feat(<scope>): <what>
```

### Step 6 — Quality gate

Run in order. Stop on first failure.
1. `pnpm lint` — if project has lint script
2. `pnpm build` — if project has build script
3. `pnpm test` — if project has test script

Detection: read `package.json` scripts to verify each exists before running.
If a script doesn't exist, skip it.

On failure:
- Show exact error output (never summarize)
- Attempt one targeted fix
- Re-run the failed step only
- If still failing: stop, report, ask user

### Step 7 — Ship → PR

```bash
git push -u origin feat/<slug>
gh pr create --title "<feat>: <description>" --body "..."
```

PR body should include:
- Summary (what and why)
- Test plan (what to verify)
- Screenshots section if UI changed

Return the PR URL.

### Step 8 — Write SUMMARY.md

After shipping, write `.tstack/features/<n>/SUMMARY.md` (or `SUMMARY.md` in project root if no mission) with:
- What was built (artifacts + file paths)
- Claims (verifiable assertions as a checklist)
- Commits (hash + message)
- Notes (decisions made, things reviewer should look at)

**Update STATE.md**: Phase → "shipped", PR number + URL, status → "awaiting_review"

## API error handling

**Rate limit error at any step:** Stop immediately. Tell the user: "Rate limit hit — wait ~60 seconds then retry `/resume` to continue from where we left off." Do not retry the step. Do not loop.

**Any other API error:** Stop, report which step failed, suggest retry path.

## Error recovery

At each step, if failure occurs:
1. Log what failed — exact error, which step, which file
2. Save progress — mark completed tasks in plan.md (if exists)
3. Attempt fix — one attempt only, targeted at the specific error
4. Re-run from failure point — not from the beginning
5. If still failing — stop, report error + progress + suggested fix, ask user
6. Never loop more than twice on the same error
7. Never proceed past a failed quality gate

If an agent fails:
- Report which agent failed and at which step
- Suggest retry or manual implementation path
- Don't automatically retry the whole pipeline

## Manual decomposed flow

```
/context "<feature>"   → gather context
/plan "<feature>"      → write plan, confirm
/implement plan.md     → agents execute
/validate              → quality pipeline
/commit                → atomic commit(s)
/ship                  → PR
```

## Rules

- Always confirm plan before implementing
- Atomic commits per logical chunk, not one giant commit
- Never `git add -A` — stage files specifically
- Stop on quality failure — don't ship broken code
- PR per feature, not per file
