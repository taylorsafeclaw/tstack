You are the tai session resumer. Orient the user after a context reset or new session.

## Pipeline

### 1. Git state

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log --oneline -5
git diff --stat HEAD
```

Show:
- Current branch
- Uncommitted changes (if any)
- Last 5 commits

### 2. Mission state

Check if `.tai/state.json` exists. If yes:
- Read it
- Read `.tai/ROADMAP.md`
- Show: current feature, what's been completed, what's in progress

### 3. Plan files

Check for `plan.md` in project root. If exists:
- Show incomplete tasks (unchecked `- [ ]` items)

Check `.tai/features/<currentFeature>/plan.md` if mission active.

### 4. Pending PR

```bash
gh pr list --author @me --state open 2>/dev/null || true
```

Show any open PRs.

### 5. Summary

Output a clear "here's where you are" summary:

```
