# CLAUDE.md — tstack Framework

tstack is a Claude Code plugin — a structured, opinionated dev workflow delivered via the plugin system, not symlinks.

## Install / uninstall

```bash
claude plugin add /path/to/tstack    # install
claude plugin remove tstack          # uninstall
```

No symlinks. The plugin system discovers all commands, agents, and skills automatically.

### Building the CLI

```bash
cd cli && cargo install --path .   # puts `tstack` on PATH
```

## Conventions

- No `tstack-` file prefix required — namespacing comes from the plugin system and directory structure
- Commands: `commands/<category>/<name>.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `model`)
- Agents: `agents/<category>/<name>.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `model`, `tools`, `maxTurns`)
- Skills: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `user-invocable`)
- Project templates: `templates/<project>/` with an `install` script

## Adding components

**New command** — drop a `.md` file into the right `commands/<category>/` directory. Auto-discovered.

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <one-line description>
argument-hint: "<hint for the user>"
model: sonnet | opus | haiku
---
```

**New agent** — drop a `.md` file into `agents/<category>/`. Auto-discovered.

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <one-line description>
model: sonnet | opus | haiku
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Edit, Write, Bash
domain: backend | frontend | schema | infrastructure | integration | testing | review | quality | orchestrator
maxTurns: 30
---
```

The `domain` field is for **project-specific agents** that participate in Agent Team dispatch. Core plugin agents (explorer, implementer, commit-analyzer, detect, fix-implementer, review-ingester) are utility/lifecycle agents — they don't have domain fields because they're dispatched directly by commands, not by domain routing. Only project agents installed via templates (e.g., a `convex` agent with `domain: schema` or a `ui` agent with `domain: frontend`) use domain-based discovery. Commands like `/feature` and `/execute` glob `.claude/agents/*.md`, read frontmatter, and dispatch agents by domain in this order: schema -> backend -> infrastructure (parallel) -> integration -> frontend -> testing -> review -> quality.

**Extended agent frontmatter:**
- `skills: [list]` — Skills the agent should load (used by review-ingester)
- `color: <name>` — Display color hint for CLI tooling (used by detect)

**Extended command frontmatter:**
- `allowed-tools: <list>` — Restrict which tools the command can use (used by commit, review-cycle, dag-execute)

**New skill** — create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Auto-discovered.

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <one-line description>
user-invocable: true | false
---
```

## The three tiers

| Tier | Command | Scope | Model |
|------|---------|-------|-------|
| Task | `/task` | Minutes, 1–3 files, single commit, no PR | sonnet |
| Feature | `/feature` | Hours, 3–10 files, Agent Team, PR | opus → sonnet |
| Mission | `/mission` | Days/weeks, multiple features, multiple PRs | opus → sonnet → haiku |

## Model strategy

- **opus** — thinking: context (`/context`), planning (`/plan`), missions, scoping, debugging. Use boost mode for hard problems.
- **sonnet** — building: implementation (`/task`, `/execute`), review, refactoring, committing
- **haiku** — running: validation (`/validate`), status, help

## Quality pipeline

Every tier runs after implementation — no opt-out:
```
pnpm lint → pnpm build → pnpm test
Stop on first failure. Never commit broken code.
```

## Extension system

All extension points support project-level overrides at `.claude/<type>/`. Highest → lowest priority: project → personal (`extensions/`) → core (this repo).

| Extension point | Location | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| Commands | `commands/<category>/<name>.md` | Slash commands |
| Agents | `agents/<category>/<name>.md` | Subagents |
| Skills | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Reusable skill modules |
| Hooks | `hooks/hooks.json` + `hooks/*.js` | Pre/post event scripts |
| CLAUDE.md | `CLAUDE.md` | Project-level instructions |
| Settings | `settings.json` | Claude behavior defaults |
| Rules | `rules/` | Path-scoped rule files |
| MCP | `.mcp.json` | MCP server configuration |
| LSP | `.lsp.json` | LSP server configuration |
| Output styles | `output-styles/` | Named response format presets |
| Agent teams | `agents/` composition | Multi-agent coordination |
| Context fork | `context:fork` in commands | Parallel context branching |

## State system (`.tstack/`)

tstack uses a file-based state directory that agents read/write, surviving context resets and sessions.

### State directory structure

├── state.json              ← mission tracker (existing)
├── .quality-passed          ← quality gate flag (existing)

    └── <id>.md              ← captured ideas/tasks
```

### STATE.md — Living Memory (The Resume Brain)

Written/read by every agent at session start. Max 100 lines. Updated after every significant action. A new Claude session reading ONLY this file should know exactly what's happening and what to do next.

```markdown
# Project State
Updated: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]

## Current Position
- Mission: <name> (if active)
- Feature: <n> of <total> — <name>
- Phase: researching | planning | implementing | reviewing | shipping | debugging
- Branch: <branch name>
- PR: #<number> (<status>) or "none"
- Last activity: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] — <exactly what happened>

## What's In Progress
<1-3 sentences describing the EXACT state of work — not vague, concrete>

## Resume Instructions
<The exact next step to take. Be specific enough that a fresh session can act immediately.>

## Completed This Session
- [x] Schema additions (commit abc1234)
- [x] Backend mutations (commit def5678)
- [ ] UI task list page (in progress — type error)
- [ ] Tests

## Agent Roster (last used)
- convex — [date] pass, built task mutations
- ui — [date] FAILED, type mismatch on TaskCard props

## Active Blockers
- <anything preventing progress>

## Key Context (don't lose this)
- <critical decisions, API shapes, gotchas discovered during this session>
```

**Update rules:**
- "What's In Progress" and "Resume Instructions" are overwritten each update (always current)
- "Completed This Session" is appended (tracks progress)
- "Key Context" is curated — add important things, remove stale things
- "Agent Roster" shows only agents used in current feature
- Max 100 lines — if approaching limit, compress older entries

### DECISIONS.md — Locked Decisions

User decisions that all agents must respect. Three levels:

```markdown
# Decisions

## Locked (must follow exactly)
- [date] Use opus for all implementation agents
- [date] Always invoke /frontend-design before UI work

## Discretion (agent can adapt if justified)
- [date] Prefer sheets over modals for detail views

## Deferred (don't work on yet)
- [date] Dark mode support
```

### AGENTS.md — Agent Activity Log

Append-only log of agent dispatches and results. Critical for resume — tells a new session what already ran and what was returned.

```markdown
# Agent Activity

## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] convex → feature: add task table
- Status: complete
- Files: convex/tasks/mutations.ts, convex/tasks/queries.ts
- API shape: api.tasks.mutations.create({ title, assignee })
- Commit: abc1234
- Quality: pass
- Handoff: API shape ready for ui agent

## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] ui → feature: task list UI
- Status: FAILED
- Error: Type error in TaskCard.tsx:42
- Files touched (uncommitted): app/(app)/tasks/page.tsx
- Resume: fix query return type, then retry
```

**Trim rule:** Keep last 20 entries. When exceeding, archive older entries to `AGENTS-archive.md`.

### features/<n>/RESEARCH.md

Written by explorer/researcher before planning. Contains: files to touch, existing patterns, dependencies, risks.

### features/<n>/SUMMARY.md

Written after implementation. Contains: what was built (artifacts + file paths), claims (verifiable assertions), commits, notes for reviewer.

### debug/<slug>.md

Persistent debug state. Sections: Symptom (fixed on creation), Current Focus (overwritten each attempt), Evidence (append-only), Resolution.

### Agent state protocol

Every agent must follow this protocol:

**On Start (every agent, every invocation):**
1. Read `.tstack/STATE.md` — understand project position, what's in progress, resume instructions
2. Read `.tstack/DECISIONS.md` — respect all locked decisions, use discretion items as guidance
3. Read feature files if working on a feature: RESEARCH.md, plan.md, SUMMARY.md
4. Check for partial work — if STATE.md says a prior agent failed or was interrupted, pick up from where it stopped

**On Complete (every agent, every invocation):**
5. Update STATE.md: "What's In Progress", "Resume Instructions", "Completed This Session", "Key Context", "Agent Roster"
6. Append to AGENTS.md — structured entry: timestamp, agent, task, status, files, handoff data
7. Mark plan.md tasks — check off completed `- [ ]` items
8. Write SUMMARY.md — if you completed the last task in a feature, write claims

**On Failure:**
9. Still update STATE.md — describe what failed and why in "What's In Progress"
10. Resume Instructions — write exactly what needs to happen to unblock
11. Don't leave orphan state — note created-but-incomplete files so next agent doesn't duplicate work

## Rust CLI (`cli/`)

The CLI provides `tstack doctor`, `tstack add`, `tstack list`, `tstack install`, etc. Built with:

| Crate | Version | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| **clap** | 4 (derive) | Arg parsing | Uses `#[derive(Parser, Subcommand, ValueEnum)]` — no builder pattern |
| **cliclack** | 0.3 | Interactive prompts | Spinners, confirm dialogs, intro/outro wrappers |
| **comfy-table** | 7 | Table rendering | Used in `tstack list` output |
| **serde** + **serde_yaml** | 1 / 0.9 | YAML frontmatter parsing | Deserialize command/agent/skill frontmatter |
| **dirs** | 6 | Home dir resolution | `dirs::home_dir()` for `~/.claude/` paths |
| **anyhow** | 1 | Error handling | `Result<()>` everywhere, `context()` for messages |
| **indicatif** | 0.17 | Progress bars/spinners | Used in install/doctor flows |
| **crossterm** | 0.28 | Terminal control | Raw mode, cursor, colors — powers the animated logo in `ui.rs` |

**For API docs on any crate, use context7** (`mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` → `mcp__context7__query-docs`) instead of vendoring docs. This keeps references current without repo bloat.

### CLI structure

```
cli/src/
├── main.rs              ← entry point, routes to subcommands
├── cli.rs               ← clap derive structs (Cli, Commands, enums)
├── config.rs            ← config file reading
├── types.rs             ← shared types
├── frontmatter.rs       ← YAML frontmatter parser
├── symlink.rs           ← symlink creation/removal logic
├── ui.rs                ← animated logo, colors, terminal rendering
└── commands/
    ├── mod.rs
    ├── add.rs            ← scaffold new command/agent/skill
    ├── doctor.rs         ← health check
    ├── install.rs        ← symlink to ~/.claude/
    ├── uninstall.rs      ← remove symlinks
    ├── list.rs           ← list installed items
    ├── run.rs            ← run a command
    ├── status.rs         ← show current state
    ├── template.rs       ← project template management
    └── version.rs        ← version display
```

### Patterns to follow

- All commands return `anyhow::Result<()>`
- Use `clap` derive macros, not builder
- Colors via `ui::write_rgb()` helper — all RGB constants defined in `ui.rs`
- Frontmatter parsing goes through `frontmatter.rs`, not ad-hoc serde
